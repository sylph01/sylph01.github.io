sylph01's website.

I will (occasionally? rarely?) post stuff in English on this website. Please check the blog for Japanese content.

## About the author

I go by sylph01 (generally) or G4CUBE (in gaming communities) on the Web. My real name can be found on slides at tech events (I tend to use my handle name more on the Web).

I develop (and help people develop) data privacy focused apps and OAuth/OpenID Connect enabled apps. I sometimes appear in standardization groups (recently at W3C's HTTPS in Local Network Community Group and Web of Things Working Group). My programming languages of choice are Ruby and Elixir.

I also:

- Play music. I play the bassoon in the orchestra.
- Play games.
  - Magic: the Gathering: Modern (Affinity variants), Legacy ([The EPIC Storm](https://theepicstorm.com/)), Commander (High-Power to cEDH)
  - DanceDanceRevolution: Single Play 9th dan, DIAMOND1 at [LIFE4](https://life4ddr.com/)
- Write tech articles/books with guys at [Cryptic Command](https://cryptic-command.net/)
  - I have self-published books ("doujinshi") on topics such as SMTP, DNS, and OAuth.
  - Yes, the group is named after the Magic: the Gathering card :)
